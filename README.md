# Numerical Handwriting Detector

This project is a basic implementation of a handwriting detector that recognizes and classifies handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This project serves as an introductory exercise to understand the workings of CNNs in the context of image recognition tasks.

## Introduction

Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify images of handwritten digits (0-9). This project uses the MNIST dataset, which is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

The project involves several key steps:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Model Training
3. Prediction
4. Model Evaluation
